# AI Fundamentals: Augmentation, Not Replacement

This page covers the key principles and patterns for using AI to augment human work and life, rather than replace it.

## Why Augment?
- AI excels at automating repetitive, data-driven tasks.
- The greatest value comes from combining human creativity, judgment, and context with AI's speed and scale.
- Augmentation means using AI as a tool to extend your abilities, not as a substitute for your expertise.

## Common Augmentation Patterns
- **Copilot**: AI assists you in real time (e.g., code completion, writing suggestions).
- **Search & Summarize**: AI finds, filters, and summarizes information for faster decision-making.
- **Automate Routine**: AI handles repetitive steps so you can focus on higher-level work.
- **Personalize**: AI adapts outputs to your style, needs, or context.
- **Explore & Prototype**: AI helps you brainstorm, generate ideas, and quickly test solutions.

## Best Practices
- Always verify AI outputs, especially for critical or factual tasks.
- Use AI to speed up the boring parts, not to replace your judgment.
- Combine multiple tools for best results (e.g., search, chat, code, design).
- Stay curious: experiment with new models and workflows.

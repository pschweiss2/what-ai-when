This document outlines planned features for What AI, When? Focused on helping people understand how AI can augment their work and life.

## Planned Features

### Tool Wizard
An interactive guided experience that helps users discover the right AI tool based on their specific task or goal. Users answer a series of questions about their needs (e.g., "What are you trying to accomplish?", "What's your technical comfort level?", "Do you need multimodal capabilities?") and receive personalized recommendations.

**Benefits:**
- Lower barrier to entry for newcomers
- Faster decision-making for specific use cases
- Educational as users learn what factors matter

### Prompt Playbooks
Curated collections of proven prompt templates and workflows organized by persona and task. Each playbook includes:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Example prompts with explanations
- Tips for customization
- Common pitfalls to avoid

**Benefits:**
- Practical, actionable guidance
- Helps users get value faster
- Demonstrates augmentation patterns
- Builds confidence in using AI tools

### ROI Estimator
A calculator that helps users estimate the time and cost savings from using AI tools. Users input:
- Time spent on recurring tasks
- Frequency of tasks
- Current hourly rate or value
- Tool costs (if applicable)

The estimator shows:
- Time saved per week/month/year
- Cost savings or value created
- Break-even analysis
- Comparison across different tools

**Benefits:**
- Helps justify AI tool adoption
- Quantifies augmentation value
- Supports budget decisions
- Encourages exploration of ROI opportunities

## Future Considerations

- Community-contributed playbooks and reviews
- Integration with actual tool APIs for live demos
- Personalized learning paths
- Version tracking for model updates and deprecations
